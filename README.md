Company: Hangzhou Public Transport Cloud Technology Co., Ltd. - Development Application Department - Java Intern

Period: 2023.09 - 2024.06



*   Data Visualization Optimization: Proposed a data indicator configuration scheme for the cockpit large screen, solved the problem of big data scheduling delay, and was recognized by the Public Transport Group and municipal leaders.

*   Project Reconstruction: Responsible for the reconstruction of some businesses in the DXT and BUSP projects, solving data inconsistency and migration problems, with a data migration accuracy rate of 100%.

*   Project Delivery: Participated in the development of the Tiger Leap Project, assisted the product manager in completing the project 3 weeks in advance through task splitting and successfully recovered the balance.

## My Education Experience.....

I studied at Xihua University.

Period: 2020.09 - 2024.06

Major: Software Engineering, School of Computer and Software Engineering

## My Project Experience



1.  Paperless Medical Record Management - Backend Architecture Design

    Period: 2024.07 - Present

    Technology Stack: Spring Boot + Ruoyi + MySQL + FastDFS + Kettle + Jacob Framework

    Project Description: To address issues such as high module coupling, poor performance, and insufficient hardware compatibility in the old system, a new generation of electronic medical record system was reconstructed and developed to support the electronic processing of over 1,000 medical records per day in tertiary hospitals.

    Key Contributions:

*   Architecture Upgrade and Efficiency Breakthrough: Built a ÂâçÂêéÁ´ØÂàÜÁ¶ª architecture based on the Ruoyi framework, reducing module coupling by 40% and shortening the new function development cycle from 2 weeks to 5 days (a 30% reduction); Introduced FastDFS distributed file storage to realize second-level upload of medical record files over 20MB, supporting 12,000 files stored daily and solving traditional storage performance bottlenecks.

*   Performance Optimization and Concurrent Enhancement: Designed a multi-threaded parallel processing engine to optimize the medical record entry interface: response time reduced from 1500ms to 240ms (an 84% optimization), and concurrency capability increased by 5 times; Optimized over 120 slow SQLs, with complex query speeds increased by 5-10 times, slow query volume decreased by 85%, and the overall system throughput significantly enhanced.

*   Data Synchronization and Consistency Assurance: Led the "Kettle + Custom Fallback Strategy" solution to realize million-level data synchronization of pdf table data, with data loss rate reduced from 8% to 0.01% through incremental extraction, breakpoint resumption, and data verification; Designed a "local transaction + MQ asynchronous compensation" mechanism to solve cross-module data consistency issues: transaction rollback success rate reached 99.8%, and monthly failures reduced from 30 to 2 (a 93% reduction in failure rate).

*   Hardware Docking Technology Breakthrough: Realized Java-C++ cross-language docking of 6 hardware devices (such as card readers) based on the Jacob framework, shortening the docking cycle from 4 weeks to 1.5 weeks (a 62.5% reduction), with a code reuse rate of 80%, becoming the company's hardware docking standard solution.

1.  Public Transport Cloud - Line Network Simulation - One of the Backend R\&D Leaders

    Period: 2023.12 - 2024.01

    Technology Stack: Spring Boot 2.6 + Dubbo 2.7 (service governance) + PostgreSQL 13 (table partitioning) + DataWorks (ETL) + Apollo (configuration center)

    Project Description: The Public Transport Group needed to realize passenger flow monitoring and line planning based on Ant Group's passenger flow data and bus card swiping data.

    Key Contributions:

*   Table Partition Design and Historical Data Query Optimization: For the passenger flow history table with over 20 million records, designed a "partition by month (YYYYMM) + table sharding by line ID" strategy (e.g., passenger\_flow\_202301\_01 table), combined with PostgreSQL partition pruning technology, shortening the query time of 3-year-old historical data from 10s to 800ms and supporting high-frequency historical data retrospective analysis.

*   Dubbo Service-oriented Architecture Decoupling: Introduced Dubbo to realize remote service calls with the user center (permission authentication, user portrait acquisition), replacing the original hard-coded HTTP interface, reducing system module coupling by 50% and shortening the new service access cycle from 3 days to 1 day.

1.  UCDT After-sales Management System - Backend Development

    Period: 2022.12 - 2023.06

    Technology Stack: Spring Boot 2.5 + Oracle 12c (main database) + SQL Server 2019 (client database) + Quartz 2.3 (distributed task scheduling) + MyBatis (data persistence)

    Project Description: Aifake Co., Ltd. needed an after-sales management system.

    Key Contributions:

*   Heterogeneous Database Synchronization Architecture Design and Implementation: Designed a "main database (Oracle) + client database (SQL Server)" distributed architecture, with the main database storing core task data (task templates, organizational structure) and the client database storing branch local data (task execution records, check-in logs), reducing the main database pressure by 50%.

*   Task Management and Mobile Function Development: Developed a task life cycle management module covering task creation (supporting Excel batch import), mobile application (App submission of task requirements), dynamic changes (real-time adjustment of task responsible persons/deadlines), and progress tracking (Gantt chart visualization), increasing task flow efficiency by 30%.
